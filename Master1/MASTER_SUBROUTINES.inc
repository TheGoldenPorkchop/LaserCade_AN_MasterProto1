;   Description:    Contains all subroutines needed for the Laser Shooting Game     *
;		    project. Subroutines include the ability to communicate via	    *
;		    UART for control, I2C write/read, and updating each target	    *
;		    slot for I2C enabling, disabling or polling.		    *

;   1:	Initialize file, get everything working the way that I thought it should    *
